<h1>C major arpeggios in 3-notes-per-string positions</h1>
<p>The following diagrams emphasize the chord tones of the three-notes-per-string positions in C major, giving an arpeggio exercise that aligns with the 3-notes-per-string exercises.</p>
<p>This also serves as an example of processing and styling stops in two ways within a single diagram. Each genrated position is filtered into separate chord and non-chord tones, labels are assigned to the chord tones only, and the lists are then remerged. Additionally, the CSS for the non-chord tones is tweaked to de-emphasize them. Thus, we see the entire 3-notes-per-string position while reading only the arpeggio that sits atop it.</p>
<script>
var scale = key('c', majorScale());
var string = guitar.strings.length - 1;

for (var i = 0; i < scale.length; i++) {
	var all    = positionScale(guitar, scale, string, i, chooseNotesPerString(3));
	var fore   = filterScaleDegree([1, 3, 5], all);
	var back   = filterScaleDegree([2, 4, 6, 7], all);
	var labels = labelPitchName(fore);
	var stops  = back.concat(fore);

	document.body.appendChild(createFretboard('simple', layout, guitar, stops));
